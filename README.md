# ðŸ›’ E-commerce Focus Search Input

This Chrome extension allows users to focus the search input field of e-commerce websites (currently Amazon and Flipkart only) with a simple key press (/).

# ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

This feature is inspired by similar functionality on YouTube, where pressing / moves the cursor to the search bar, enabling users to start typing their search query immediately.

# ðŸ¤¨ Why I made this?

I've accustomed to using the `/` key to quickly jump to the search bar on YouTube. It's a habit that speeds up my browsing significantly. So, naturally, when I switch over to e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart, I find myself pressing `/` out of muscle memory, expecting the search field to become active. The realization that this shortcut doesn't work on these platforms means I have to manually move my cursor to the search bar and click it, which feels inconvenient and slows me down. This inspired me to create a solution.
